      <h2>The Ego, and its role in ideology:</h2>
      <p><span style="line-height:1.7;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
      <p> Human beings commonly associate their very identity and
        substance as a person with their beliefs about various issues.
        Such association constitutes a false conception of self (the ego
        – noting that we are using the Eastern conception of the term
        here), in contrast to the true self (the indwelling Spirit),
        which is eternal and independent of changing physical, mental
        and emotional states.</p>
      <p>We see the exact same patterns of behaviour occurring across
        humanity. Once someone has identified with an ideology they will
        go to great lengths to sustain that belief system, even in light
        of overwhelming evidence, which falsifies that ideology. It
        doesn’t matter whether it is religion and philosophy, politics
        and economics, racial or national identity or support of a
        football team or car manufacturer, the ego will refuse to see
        the weaknesses in the source of its identity, and will seek to
        diminish those that it sees in opposition to its ideology.</p>
      <p>Whilst egoic thinking leads various people to believe that
        those that differ from them are suffering from a dysfunction of
        which they themselves are exempt, the reality is that the very
        same subconscious processes motivate people at opposite ends of
        ideological disputes. Hence, when attempting to promote progress
        in various fields we are not simply faced with the task of
        making the case for our perspective. Rather, we must face the
        ego of those that have identified with an opposing position.
        Hence, if we expect others to be willing to change beliefs which
        they hold sacred (whether religious or not), we must demonstrate
        a willingness to do the same when necessary.</p>
      <p><strong>Main Article:</strong></p>
      <p>The Latin word “ego” became popular in the English language as
        the translation of Sigmund Freud’s conception of “I” (as part of
        his three-part conception of self), though the meaning of the
        term has largely been expanded in everyday use. Many people are
        using it as an English translation for the Sanskrit word <em>Ahamkara</em>,
        and that is effectively how I will be using it in this article.</p>
      <p>In its Eastern definition, the ego is the false self that
        cohabits the human being along with the indwelling Spirit (<em>Atman</em>
        in Sanskrit). The ego is our temporary sense of identity that
        the mind creates through association and attachment to various
        features of our life. Not knowing that we have an indwelling and
        immortal Spirit within us, we believe that our very sense of
        identity is dependent upon fragile and temporary structures, and
        hence we naturally seek to defend these structures. If our
        belief system is threatened then <em>we</em> feel threatened,
        and our response reveals that we believe that our very existence
        is at stake.</p>
      <p>Human beings identify with various things in an attempt to
        increase the ego’s perception of itself, and this often involves
        diminishing others in return. The ego seems to think that it
        must drag others down in order to uplift itself, and in doing so
        it creates suffering for all. Hence, the ego will seek to only
        see the strengths of whatever it is identifying with (even to
        the point of seeing strengths that aren’t actually there),
        whilst refusing to acknowledge its own weaknesses. Likewise, it
        often refuses to see the strengths of those it views as
        opponents, and will seek to highlight, exaggerate or even invent
        flaws in those it opposes.</p>
      <p>We see the very same egoic behaviour at play throughout human
        existence, from various forms of human interaction and
        relationships, to the interplay of religious, political, racial
        and national identities. The ego continually causes conflict,
        creates drama and causes suffering in many forms. Under the
        misguided belief that there is a finite amount of life force to
        be shared between living things, it behaves as if it needs to
        steal energy from others to be nourished. The ego sabotages
        relationships, causing all sort of dysfunctional interactions on
        the basis of various subconscious urges.</p>
      <p>In the case of religion, the ego drives followers of various
        faiths to completely identify with their religious beliefs; to
        the point that they are willing to see those outside their sect
        as evil. Egoic thinking drives believers to refuse to accept
        evidence and logic that refutes their sacred beliefs, and leads
        to them developing all manner of defence mechanisms to hold
        their ground in face of information that should lead to a
        reasonable and intelligent person changing their opinion.</p>
      <p>Likewise, in the field of politics, the ego drives people to
        identify with one side of the political spectrum, and to
        perceive those on the other side as being responsible for all
        the ills of their nation, or the world. Politics concerns
        various issues where there are complementary truths that need to
        be balanced. People on both sides of the spectrum take their
        identification as primary in their political beliefs, and fail
        to consider individual topics on their own merits. Hence we see
        both the left and right fail to find the right balance in
        complex topics where multiple factors need to be considered.
        Rather people on the left frequently always take the same side
        on every issue regardless of the specific details of the case.
        Likewise, those on the right do exactly the same. Hence both the
        left and right see each other as responsible for all the ills of
        society.</p>
      <p>What irony that the very same personality dysfunction is at the
        heart of both extreme ends! Whilst the precise ideology that
        those on the left and right have identified with is different,
        the core dysfunction is the same. Again, the same is true in
        regards to conservative follows of different faiths. What irony
        that conservative Christians and Muslims are both operating from
        the very same core psychological processes, despite seeing each
        other as being at the opposite ends of eternity!</p>
      <p>When I first started out as a writer I had this naïve idea that
        human beings were rational creatures, and that all one had to do
        was present an argument properly, well reasoned with reference
        to evidence and human beings would change their opinions.
        Unfortunately the reality is that the ego is incredibly skilled
        at holding its ground and avoiding letting go of the beliefs
        that it identifies with. Hence, human beings do not usually
        change their beliefs when they encounter evidence that rebuts
        them. Rather, they jump through flaming hoops and adopt all
        sorts of logical fallacies; often simply resorting to insulting
        those they see as their opponents in order to avoid facing the
        possibility that their opponent may be correct.</p>
      <p>Human beings need to remember that we are capable of changing
        our opinions. If we expect others to do so, then the first thing
        to do would be to demonstrate it ourselves. There is an old
        saying that goes something like: “<em>If you wish to create
          peace in the world, start with yourself</em>”. I can
        understand if many people think that this is just a copout or
        that it is selfish, like it is suggesting that people simply
        focus on making themselves happy rather than fighting for the
        things that really matter in life. The truth however is that if
        we wish others to overcome their individual egos, and if we wish
        humanity at large to overcome large-scale collective egos (such
        as religious or political organizations, or national
        identities), then we ourselves need to lead by example by
        overcoming our own egos and finding real peace within ourselves.
        Peace really does start within.</p>
      <p>Finding inner-peace doesn’t have to mean that you don’t stand
        up for what is good and real. Rather, finding peace first will
        mean that when you encounter resistance you wont take it
        personally, and won’t let your own ego sabotage the legitimate
        cause for which you are standing for. We cannot expect others to
        stop identifying with their philosophical and political
        ideologies if we ourselves are unable to transcend our own
        personality defects. Hence, we must lead by example by honestly
        seeking truth wherever it lies, and being willing to change our
        views when presented with reliable evidence and solid logic to
        the contrary.</p>
      <p>The irony is that human beings fear that we will become less if
        we let go of the things that we have identified with. The truth
        however is that the exact opposite is true. In giving up a drop
        of water we gain the ocean. Whilst human beings frequently go
        from one egoic identification to another, the release of a false
        identity brings the opportunity to discover our true eternal
        nature. When we silence the incessant mental chatter and
        dis-identify from the voice within our heads we realise that we
        are not our opinions, beliefs, skills, habits nor preferences,
        nor is our true identity to be found within our flesh and blood.
        Rather, inner silence brings forth the indwelling Spirit, and
        with it comes unspeakable joy that is not dependent upon
        external circumstances, and hence need not come and go due to
        circumstances beyond our control. Rather, the inner peace that
        comes with true presence can be felt permanently, if we choose
        to cultivate it and transcend the ego.</p>
      <p>I am a big fan of Eckhart Tolle’s writing. His books are not
        interesting in the traditional sense; he is not a captivating
        writer, nor a particularly charismatic speaker. He is however a
        very good spiritual teacher and he is utterly brilliant at
        highlighting the human condition. His insights into human
        behaviour are essentially spot-on, and for that reason I suggest
        that “The Power Of Now” and “A New Earth” are essential reading
        for everyone. They are books that should be read over and over
        again; not because they are captivating, but because they are
        true, and they can assist in probably the most significant
        transformation that anybody can undergo.</p>

      <p> Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was perfectly timed to fill the
        emptiness left by the collapse of COVID restrictions. And what
        the reaction says about us matters more than what it says about
        Ukraine. </p>
      <p> The desperate hunger for new causes is a spiritual vacuum. The
        Ukranians and the Russians believe in what they’re fighting for.
        We believe in the need to believe in something. The conflict
        over Ukraine stretches back centuries while our fervent
        investment in it goes back a few weeks. </p>
      <p>It is quite likely that a few weeks from now we will be just as
        invested in something else. </p>
      <p>It is no coincidence that certian parts of America
        are the most invested in this war, much as they’re the most
        invested in the COVID culture wars, and all the
        culture wars that have come before and that will come after to
        fill the void in their souls. </p>
      <p>People without a purpose to their passions rush from one cause
        to another in search of a momentary sense of meaning. Conspiracy
        theories make the world meaningful and nurture their sense of
        outrage because it distracts them from the aching emptiness
        within. </p>
      <p>Radical politics acts as a substitute religion with its own
        theology, momentous destiny and personal commitment, but without
        any sense of personal connection or enduring continuity. What is
        true in politics one week may not be so the next. Political
        touchstones shift and the partisan who is at the heart of the
        cause may find that a few years later he’s an outside enemy.

      <p>“Before I get started, I just wanted to ask if we could just
        for a moment and talk about Ukraine and what is going on there.
        I had never been to eastern Europe until I actually went on my
        leave for my first deployment in Iraq. Instead of going back to
        Hawaii, I chose to go to eastern Europe. I went to Poland,
        visited Auschwitz, visited the ghettos in Warsaw, and then I
        went to Ukraine and I made some wonderful friends there, people
        who I became closer to as the years went on. </p>
      <p>“And so many people who are stuck in Ukraine right now, many of
        them are stuck in Kiev, others are trying to make their way to
        the border with Poland, afraid, worried about their loved ones,
        their husbands unable to leave and it’s heartbreaking, it’s
        heartbreaking to see this tragedy play out. So I just wanted to
        ask [if] we could just pause for a moment of silence and send
        our prayers for their safety and for their well-being.</p>
      <p>“….It wouldn’t surprise you to know that on social media and
        Twitter the ‘blue check marks’ started lighting up and you know
        I kind of started to see coming from the so-called
        ‘progressives’ the usual things coming out, saying, ‘Tulsi
        Gabbard is going to CPAC, she’s a traitor, Hillary was right,
        get her out of here.’ And then I started to see the things
        coming up from so-called ‘conservatives’…’Don’t you know she’s a
        Democrat? Cancel her, disinvite her, lock the doors, don’t let
        her in. </p>
      <p>“While these things can be easy to laugh about sometimes,
        unfortunately this kind of reaction, this kind of tribalism is
        not limited to social media. It is something that’s happening
        far too often and [is] far too common across our
        country….&nbsp;this kind of tribalism is dangerous and it’s
        emblematic of an erosion of a spiritual foundation in this
        country.”</p>
      <p>“It’s emblematic of this lack of recognition that we are all
        God’s children, that we are one nation under God, and knowing
        that inspires us. It inspires us to look within and find that
        fundamental respect and care that we should have for one
        another.</p>
      <p>“And so when I came out here I said ‘aloha’ because this is
        what ‘aloha’ really means….&nbsp;most people think it means
        hello and goodbye, but…&nbsp;the deeper meaning there…&nbsp;[is
        that] I recognize that we are all children of God and I come to
        you with respect, and I come to you with this heartfelt love
        that no matter where we come, from the color of our skin, our
        religion or even our politics, we respect each other in that
        spirit of aloha.”</p>
      <p>“This spirit of aloha is actually what is at the heart of our
        Declaration of Independence. It is what is the foundation of our
        Constitution when we say ‘we hold these truths to be
        self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are
        endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that
        among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
      <p>“Our freedom comes from God, not from any other person, not
        from anyone in government. Our freedom comes from God, and to
        recognize others as children of God is to appreciate that we
        belong to God and no one else. So naturally therefore no one has
        the right to take away that intrinsic freedom which God has
        given us. This is the foundation of the social construct of the
        United States of America, this is what is at the foundation of
        our Constitution.</p>
      <p>“As you well know, Congress shall make no law respecting an
        establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
        thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or
        the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition
        the government for redress of grievances.</p>
      <p>“This foundation of freedom is what makes us who we are as
        Americans. This foundation of freedom for me is deeply ingrained
        in who I am both as a soldier and as an American. That oath that
        I took to support and defend the Constitution of the United
        States of America against all enemies foreign and domestic is
        one that is seared into my heart.</p>
      <p>“Now I know we have many veterans here in the hall tonight many
        who are watching from home. Those of you who have worn or still
        wear the uniform, you know exactly what I’m talking about. You
        know how seriously we take this oath, and like the many great
        Americans that we’ve had the privilege of serving alongside, the
        great Americans who have come before us, upon whose shoulders we
        stand, we are united in this unwavering commitment to freedom.</p>
      <p>“We recognize that while we may disagree with what you say, we
        are willing to lay our lives down to defend your right to say
        it. That is freedom, and that’s the core of who we are as a
        nation. It is what makes our country that shining city on the
        hill. So as long as we’re committed to this foundation of
        freedom that’s enshrined in our Constitution, our Bill of
        Rights, we can recognize our differences and work together based
        on that common ground, coming from that common foundation of
        freedom, we can overcome the great obstacles and challenges that
        we face. But if we are not committed to this freedom that is so
        clearly spelled out in the Bill of Rights, we are doomed to fail
        as a country.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately we have too many Americans including leaders in
        positions of great power in our country who are not at all
        committed to upholding the Constitution. We have many Americans
        who don’t even know what the Bill of Rights are. They think free
        speech is something that should only be left to those who agree
        with them, saying, ‘Hey, you know what? If your speech offends
        me or if it offends anyone, then you should not be allowed to
        say it.’</p>
      <p>“This is where we are as a country. We have too many people in
        positions of power whose foremost responsibility is to protect
        our freedoms and uphold our God-given rights and yet they are
        the ones who are trying to take these rights away from us. </p>
      <p>“This is the biggest threat to our country. It is not coming
        from some foreign country, it is coming from [the] power elite
        here at home and their co-conspirators in the mainstream media
        and the security state who are working to undermine our freedoms
        from within.</p>
      <p>“Now just the latest strategy and tactic that they’re using, to
        try to undermine our free speech by taking it upon themselves to
        say they’ve got the responsibility to protect us from so-called
        ‘misinformation. So basically they’re saying that they’re going
        to protect us from that which they claim is not true.</p>
      <p>“The notion that we must just blindly accept and follow as
        truth that which the government or those in power tells us is
        true goes against the very essence of our Constitution and Bill
        of Rights….created as a resounding rejection of the reign of
        kings and churches and authorities. There’s a reason the
        preamble of the Constitution begins with ‘we the people.’
        There’s a reason our Declaration of Independence says that to
        secure these rights governments are instituted among men
        deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.</p>
      <p>“Why is it important that we say these words? Why is it
        important that we remember them, that we actually understand why
        they serve as the bedrock of this country? The reason why it’s
        important is because in defiance of the Constitution we now have
        leaders in our government working with their mouthpieces in the
        mainstream media and big tech doing exactly what our founders
        rejected, and they’re doing so backed by the most lethal force
        on earth. </p>
      <p>“As they appoint themselves as the sole authority and voice of
        truth of information, they get to decide what is true and what
        is false. They get to decide what is information or
        misinformation and they expect we the people to just blindly
        accept and follow. This is where we’re at today. it is in direct
        opposition to the Constitution that the power elite is actively
        suppressing voices, opinions and information that they don’t
        like, that those who dare to even question the authority are
        accused of spreading misinformation and are therefore targeted
        and smeared and cancelled and silenced.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen their playbook repeatedly discredit and censor
        anyone who challenges them. Why? Because they know that their
        propaganda will not hold up to scrutiny, that rather than engage
        in debate on substance or even answer very simple questions
        about their policies, they instead immediately resort to smears
        and name-calling. I’m sure you’ve heard them all before, I
        certainly have.</p>
      <p>“Like today, Tito’s got his hand raised. Russian asset, White
        supremacist bigot, racist extremist traitor, but what’s even
        more dangerous than this threat of being canceled is the federal
        government’s wielding of its power and might to punish those who
        dare to question or disagree with their policies.</p>
      <p>“I’ll give you one example. If you go to DHS.gov, you’ll find
        that Biden’s Department of Homeland Security summarizes the
        three factors that led them to declare that we are in a
        heightened state of a domestic terrorism threat. The first of
        those three factors is, quote, “the proliferation of false or
        misleading narratives which sow discord or undermine public
        trust in U.S. government institutions.” I want to read that
        again because it’s important. “The proliferation of false or
        misleading narratives which so discord or undermine public trust
        in U.S. government institutions.” This isn’t a theory; it’s
        reality, and it’s a reality we’re witnessing right now in
        Canada, where an autocratic leader has resorted to genuinely
        authoritarian and tyrannical means to suppress a peaceful mass
        protest against the power elite.</p>
      <p>“Everything that we see happening up North, everything from the
        execution of emergency powers to the freezing of bank accounts,
        the seizure of children from parents, the destruction of
        livelihoods and small businesses, all of these things could
        happen here. </p>
      <p>“So the question I ask myself in confronting all this is: What
        are they so afraid of? Who are they afraid of? </p>
      <p>“You know the answer. It’s simple. They’re afraid of us.</p>
      <p>“They’re afraid of a free people. They’re afraid of a free
        society.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got to believe that Thomas Jefferson was thinking about
        these cowardly fearful leaders when he said they ‘prefer the
        calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty.’</p>
      <p>“They’re afraid of the freedom that empowers each and every one
        of us to seek the truth, to speak freely, to question their
        decisions and their authority. They’re afraid of losing power,
        knowing full well the intent of our founders when they wrote in
        the Declaration of Independence that governments are instituted
        among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the
        governed, and that whenever any form of government becomes
        destructive of these ends it’s the right of the people to alter
        or abolish it and institute a new government, a government of
        the people, by the people, and for the people. </p>
      <p>“This is what scares them and this is what empowers us. </p>
      <p>“So I want to ask you join me in pausing for a second as we
        step into an alternate universe, one where our leaders actually
        took their oath of office to the Constitution seriously. One
        where they really cared about us and our security and our
        freedom. </p>
      <p>“If we were living in this world, they would shut down secret
        FISA courts and stop three-letter agencies like the NSA, FBI and
        CIA from illegally spying on Americans. They would denounce the
        Attorney General of the United States for his disgraceful
        attacks on American parents like those from Loudoun County [VA]
        and across the country who are concerned for their children’s
        education.</p>
      <p>“….Our leaders would haul James Clapper before a judge to
        answer for his lies to Congress about how the government’s
        collecting information from all of our phone records, and they
        would support the Durham investigation into Clinton corruption
        in 2016 and beyond and make sure that those responsible are held
        accountable.</p>
      <p>“But this isn’t the world we live in. They’re not going to do
        this. Instead they’re doubling down and they’re cracking down,
        this power elite operation, to crush freedom of speech. [It] is
        the enemy attack from within, and it threatens the very core of
        our democratic republic.</p>
      <p>“It’s a complete betrayal of the vision that our founders had
        for this country, and it is a direct attack on the mission laid
        out in the Declaration of Independence, where instead of a
        government ordained to secure these rights, we now face a
        government determined to take them away. This is not hyperbole.
        Think about the impact of this. </p>
      <p>“And this is the point: How can we vote for President when we
        don’t have the freedom to actively participate in the
        marketplace of ideas, when we don’t have the freedom to listen
        to other perspectives, when we don’t have the freedom to ask
        questions, to challenge the establishment narrative, and we
        can’t do this as long as we live in a society filled with
        intimidation and fear of being targeted? </p>
      <p>We saw it with the Patriot Act, we saw it with COVID, and we’re
        seeing it happening now in the name of democracy as again our
        government works with Big Tech to censor ‘misinformation’ about
        what’s going on with Russia’s war with Ukraine. </p>
      <p>“So, what should we do? Each of us, in our own way, must take a
        stand to protect our freedoms and rights, making our voices
        heard, holding our leaders accountable, and forcing our leaders
        in Washington to take their oath to uphold the Constitution to
        heart and take action to pass legislation that restores and
        protects our freedoms and liberties.</p>
      <p>“But as we look forward, we can take heart in knowing that our
        path will be lit by the fire of freedom that burns brightly in
        the hearts of Americans in every community, every home, every
        church, every classroom all across this country, in small towns
        and in big cities. </p>
      <p>“We have decided that we belong to no one but God. </p>
      <p>“We are not subjects or slaves of those who govern. </p>
      <p>“By God’s grace, we are free and we will fight to remain free.</p>
      <p>“Thank you so much for having me here today. May God bless you
        and may God bless America.”</p>

      <p><b>Nonmoral Nature</b></p>
      <p>by Stephen Jay Gould</p>
      <br>
      <p> When the Right Honorable and Reverend Francis Henry, earl of
        Bridgewater, died in February, 1829, he left £8,000 to support a
        series of books "on the power, wisdom and goodness of God, as
        manifested in the creation." William Buckland, England's first
        official academic geologist and later dean of Westminster, was
        invited to compose one of the nine Bridgewater Treatises. In it
        he discussed the most pressing problem of natural theology: if
        God is benevolent and the creation displays his "power, wisdom
        and goodness," then why are we surrounded with pain, suffering,
        and apparently senseless cruelty in the animal world?</p>
      <p align="Justify">Buckland considered the depredation of
        "carnivorous races" as the primary challenge to an idealized
        world where the lion might dwell with the lamb. He resolved the
        issue to his satisfaction by arguing that carnivores actually
        increase "the aggregate of animal enjoyment" and "diminish that
        of pain." Death, after all, is swift and relatively painless,
        victims are spared the ravages of decrepitude and senility, and
        populations do not outrun their food supply to the greater
        sorrow of all. God knew what he was doing when he made lions.
        Buckland concluded in hardly concealed rapture:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">The appointment of death by the agency of
          carnivora as the ordinary termination of animal existence,
          appears therefore in its main results to be a dispensation of
          benevolence; it deducts much from the aggregate amount of the
          pain of universal death; it abridges, and almost annihilates,
          throughout the brute creation, the misery of disease, and
          accidental injuries, and lingering decay; and impose such
          salutary restraint upon excessive increase of numbers, that
          the supply of food maintains perpetually a due ratio to the
          demand. The result is, that the surface of the land and depths
          of the waters are ever crowded with myriads of animated
          beings, the pleasures of whose life are coextensive with its
          duration; and which throughout the little day of existence
          that is allotted to them, fulfill with joy the functions for
          which they were created.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">We may find a certain amusing charm in
        Buckland's vision today, but such arguments did begin to address
        "the problem of evil" for many of Buckland's contemporaries —
        how could a benevolent God create such a world of carnage and
        bloodshed? Yet this argument could not abolish the problem of
        evil entirely, for nature includes many phenomena far more
        horrible in our eyes than simple predation. I suspect nothing
        evokes greater disgust in most of us than slow destruction of a
        host by an internal parasite — gradual ingestion, bit by bit,
        from the inside. In no other way can I explain why <i>Alien</i>,
        an uninspired, grade-C, formula horror film, should have won
        such a following. That single scene of Mr. Alien popping forth
        as a baby parasite from the body of a human host, was both
        sickening and stunning. Our nineteenth-century forebears
        maintained similar feelings. The greatest challenge to their
        concept of a benevolent deity was not simple predation — but
        slow death by parasitic ingestion. The classic case, treated at
        length by all great naturalists, invoked the so-called ichneumon
        fly. Buckland had sidestepped the major issue.</p>
      <p align="Justify">The "ichneumon fly," which provoked such
        concern among natural theologians, was actually a composite
        creature representing the habits of an enormous tribe. The
        ichneumonoidea are a group of wasps, not flies, that include
        more species than all the vertebrates combined (wasp, with ants
        and bees, constitute the order Hymenoptera; flies, with their
        two wings — wasps have four — form the order Diptera). In
        addition, many non-ichneumonoid wasps of similar habits were
        often cited for the same grisly details. Thus, the famous story
        did not merely implicate a single aberrant species (perhaps a
        perverse leakage from Satan's realm), but hundreds of thousands
        — a large chunk of what could only be God's creation.</p>
      <p align="Justify">The ichneumon, like most wasps, generally live
        freely as adults but pass their larva life as parasites feeding
        on the bodies of other animals, almost invariably members of
        their own phylum, the Arthropoda. The most common victims are
        caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae), but some ichneumons
        prefer aphids and other attack spiders. Most host are
        parasitized as larvae, but some adults are attacked, and many
        tiny ichneumons inject their brood directly into the eggs of
        their host.</p>
      <p align="Justify">The free-flying females locate an appropriate
        host and then convert it into a food factory for their own
        young. Parasitologists speak of ectoparasitism when the
        uninvited guest lives on the surface of its host, and
        endoparasitism when the parasite dwells within. Among
        endoparasitic ichneumons, adult females pierce the host with
        their ovipositor and deposit eggs within. (The ovipositor, a
        thin tube extending backward from the wasp's rear end, may be
        many times as long as the body itself.) Usually, the host is not
        otherwise inconvenienced for the moment, at least until the eggs
        hatch and the ichneumon larvae begin their grim work of interior
        excavation.</p>
      <p align="Justify">Among ectoparasites, however, many females lay
        their eggs directly upon the host's body. Since an active host
        would easily dislodge the egg, the ichneumon mother often
        simultaneously injects a toxin that paralyzes the caterpillar or
        other victim. The paralyzes may be permanent, and the
        caterpillar lies, alive but immobile, with the agent of its
        future destruction secure on its belly. The egg hatches, the
        helpless caterpillar twitches, the wasp larvae pierces and
        begins its grisly feast.</p>
      <p align="Justify">Since a dead and decaying caterpillar will do
        the wasp larvae no good, it eats in a pattern that cannot help
        but recall, in our inappropriate anthropocentric interpretation,
        the ancient English penalty for treason — drawing and
        quartering, with its explicit object of extracting as much
        torment as possible by keeping the victim alive and sentient. As
        the king's executioner drew out and burned his client's
        entrails, so does the ichneumon larvae eat fat bodies and
        digestive organs first, keeping the caterpillar alive by
        preserving intact the essential heart and central nervous
        system. Finally, the larvae completes its work and kills its
        victim, leaving behind the caterpillar's empty shell. Is it any
        wonder that ichneumons, not snakes or lions, stood as the
        paramount challenge to God's benevolence during the heyday of
        natural theology?</p>
      <p align="Justify">As I read through the nineteenth- and
        twentieth-century literature on ichneumons, nothing amused me
        more than the tension between an intellectual knowledge that
        wasps should not be described in human terms and a literary or
        emotional inability to avoid the familiar categories of epic and
        narrative, pain and destruction, victim and vanquisher. We seem
        to be caught in the mythic structures of our own cultural sagas,
        quite unable, even in our basic descriptions, to use any other
        language than the metaphors of battle and conquest. We cannot
        render this corner of natural history as anything but story,
        combining the themes of grim horror and fascination and usually
        ending not so much with pity for the caterpillar as with
        admiration for the efficiency of the ichneumon.</p>
      <p align="Justify">I detect two basic themes in most epic
        descriptions: the struggles of prey and the ruthless efficiency
        of parasites. Although we acknowledge that we may be witnessing
        little more than automatic instinct or physiological reaction,
        still we describe the defenses of hosts as though they
        represented conscious struggles. Thus, aphids kick and
        caterpillars may wriggle violently as wasps attempt to insert
        their ovipositors. The pupa of the tortoiseshell butterfly
        (usually considered an inert creature silently awaiting its
        conversion from duckling to swan) may contort its abdominal
        region so sharply that attacking wasps are thrown into the air.
        The caterpillars of <i>Hapalia</i>, when attacked by the wasp <i>Apanteles
          machaeralis</i>, drop suddenly from their leaves and suspend
        themselves in air by a silken thread. But the wasp may run down
        the thread and insert its eggs nonetheless. Some hosts can
        encapsulate the injected egg with blood cells that aggregate and
        harden, thus suffocating the parasite.</p>
      <p align="Justify">J. H. Fabre, the great nineteenth-century
        French entomologist, who remains to this day the preeminently
        literate natural historian of insects, made a special study of
        parasitic wasps and wrote with an unabashed anthropocentrism
        about the struggles of paralyzed victims (see his books <i>Insect</i>
        <i>Life</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Wonders</i> <i>of</i> <i>Instinct</i>).
        He describes some imperfectly paralyzed caterpillars that
        struggle so violently every time a parasite approaches that the
        wasp larvae must feed with unusual caution. They attach
        themselves to a silken strand from the roof of their burrow and
        descend upon a safe and exposed part of the caterpillar:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">The grub is at dinner: head downwards, it is
          digging into the limp belly of one of the caterpillars. . . .
          At the least sign of danger in the heap of caterpillars, the
          larva retreats . . . and climbs back to the ceiling, where the
          swarming rabble cannot reach it. When peace is restored, it
          slides down [its silken cord] and returns to table, with its
          head over the viands and its rear upturned and ready to
          withdraw in case of need.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In another chapter, he describes the fate of a paralyzed
        cricket:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">One may see the cricket, bitten to the quick,
          vainly move its antennae and abdominal styles, open and close
          its empty jaws, and even move a foot, but the larva is safe
          and searches its vitals with impunity. What an awful nightmare
          for the paralyzed cricket!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">Fabre even learned to feed some paralyzed
        victims by placing a syrup of sugar and water on their
        mouthparts — thus showing that they remained alive, sentient,
        and (by implication) grateful for any palliation of their
        inevitable fate. If Jesus, immobile and thirsting on the cross,
        received only vinegar from his tormentors, Fabre at least could
        make an ending bittersweet.</p>
      <p align="Justify">The second theme, ruthless efficiency of the
        parasites, leads to the opposite conclusion — grudging
        admiration for the victors. We learn of their skill in capturing
        dangerous hosts often many times larger than themselves.
        Caterpillars may be easy game, but psammocharid wasps prefer
        spiders. They must insert their ovipositors in a safe and
        precise spot. Some leave a paralyzed spider in its own burrow. <i>Planiceps</i>
        <i>hirsutus</i>, for example, parasitizes a California trapdoor
        spider. It searches for spider tubes on sand dunes, then digs
        into nearby sand to disturb the spider's home and drive it out.
        When the spider emerges, the wasp attacks, paralyzes its victim,
        drags it back into its own tube, shuts and fastens the trapdoor,
        and deposits a single egg upon the spider's abdomen. Other
        psamunocharids will drag a heavy spider back to a previously
        prepared cluster of clay or mud cells. Some amputate a spider's
        legs to make the passage easier. Others fly back over water,
        skimming a buoyant spider along the surface.</p>
      <p align="Justify">Some wasps must battle with other parasites
        over a host's body. <i>Rhyssella</i> <i>curvipes</i> can
        detect the larvae of wood wasps deep within alder wood and drill
        down to a potential victim with its sharply ridged ovipositor. <i>Pseudorhyssa</i>
        <i>alpestris</i>, a related parasite, cannot drill directly into
        wood since its slender ovipositor bears only rudimentary cutting
        ridges. It locates the holes made by <i>Rhyssella</i>, inserts
        its ovipositor, and lays an egg on the host (already
        conveniently paralyzed by <i>Rhyssella</i>), right next to the
        egg deposited by its relative. The two eggs hatch at about the
        same time, but the larva of <i>Pseudorhyssa</i> has a bigger
        head bearing much larger mandibles. <i>Pseudorhyssa</i> seizes
        the smaller <i>Rhyssella</i> larva, destroys it, and proceeds
        to feast upon a banquet already well prepared.</p>
      <p align="Justify">Other praises for the efficiency of mothers
        invoke the themes of early, quick, and often. Many ichneumons
        don't even wait for their hosts to develop into larvae, but
        parasitize the egg directly (larval wasps may then either drain
        the egg itself or enter the developing host larva). Others
        simply move fast. <i>Apanteles</i> <i>militaris</i> can
        deposit up to seventy-two eggs in a single second. Still others
        are doggedly persistent. <i>Aphidius</i> <i>gomezi</i> females
        produce up to 1,500 eggs and can parasitize as many as 600
        aphids in a single working day. In a bizarre twist upon "often,"
        some wasps indulge in polyembryony, a kind of iterated
        supertwinning. A single egg divides into cells that aggregate
        into as many as 500 individuals. Since some polyembryonic wasps
        parasitize caterpillars much larger than themselves and may lay
        up to six eggs in each, as many as 3,000 larvae may develop
        within, and feed upon a single host. These wasps are
        endoparasites and do not paralyze their victims. The
        caterpillars writhe back and forth, not (one suspects) from
        pain, but merely in response to the commotion induced by
        thousands of wasp larvae feeding within.</p>
      <p align="Justify">Maternal efficiency is often matched by larval
        aptitude. I have already mentioned the pattern of eating less
        essential parts first, thus keeping the host alive and fresh to
        its final and merciful dispatch. After the larva digests every
        edible morsel of its victim (if only to prevent later fouling of
        its abode by decaying tissue), it may still use the outer shell
        of its host. One aphid parasite cuts a hole in the bottom of its
        victim's shell, glues the skeleton to a leaf by sticky
        secretions from its salivary gland, and then spins a cocoon to
        pupate within the aphid's shell.</p>
      <p align="Justify">In using inappropriate anthropocentric language
        for this romp through the natural history of ichneumons, I have
        tried to emphasize just why these wasps became a preeminent
        challenge to natural theology — the antiquated doctrine that
        attempted to infer God's essence from the products of his
        creation. I have used twentieth-century examples for the most
        part, but all themes were known and stressed by the great
        nineteenth-century natural theologians. How then did they square
        the habits of these wasps with the goodness of God? How did they
        extract themselves from this dilemma of their own making?</p>
      <p align="Justify">The strategies were as varied as the
        practitioners; they shared only the theme of special pleading
        for an a priori doctrine — our naturalists <i>knew</i> that
        God's benevolence was lurking somewhere behind all these tales
        of apparent horror. Charles Lyell, for example, in the first
        edition of his epochal <i>Principles</i> <i>of</i> <i>Geology</i>
        (1830-1833), decided that caterpillars posed such a threat to
        vegetation that any natural checks upon them could only reflect
        well upon a creating deity, for caterpillars would destroy human
        agriculture "did not Providence put causes in operation to keep
        them in due bounds."</p>
      <p align="Justify">The Reverend William Kirby, rector of Barham,
        and Britain's foremost entomologist, chose to ignore the plight
        of caterpillars and focused instead upon the virtue of mother
        love displayed by wasps in provisioning their young with such
        care.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">The great object of the female is to discover
          a proper nidus for her eggs. In search of this she is in
          constant motion. Is the caterpillar of a butterfly or moth the
          appropriate food for her young? You see her alight upon the
          plants where they are most usually to be met with, run quickly
          over them, carefully examining every leaf, and, having found
          the unfortunate object of her search, insert her sting into
          its flesh, and there deposit an egg. . . . The active
          Ichneumon braves every danger, and does not desist until her
          courage and address have insured subsistence for one of her
          future progeny.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">Kirby found this solicitude all the more
        remarkable because the female wasp will never see her child and
        enjoy the pleasures of parenthood. Yet her love compels her to
        danger nonetheless:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">A very large proportion of them are doomed to
          die before their young come into existence. But in these the
          passion is not extinguished. . . . When you witness the
          solicitude with which they provide for the security and
          sustenance of their future young, you can scarcely deny to
          them love for a progeny they are never destined to behold.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">Kirby also put in a good word for the marauding
        larvae, praising them for their forbearance in eating
        selectively to keep their caterpillar prey alive. Would we all
        husband our resources with such care!</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">In this strange and apparently cruel
          operation one circumstance is truly remarkable. The larva of
          the Ichneumon, though every day, perhaps for months, it gnaws
          the inside of the caterpillar, and though at last it has
          devoured almost every part of it except the skin and
          intestines, carefully all this time it avoids injuring the
          vital organs, as if aware that its own existence depends on
          that of the insect upon which it preys! . . . What would be
          the impression which a similar instance amongst the race of
          quadrupeds would make upon us? If, for example, an animal . .
          . should be found to feed upon the inside of a dog, devouring
          only those parts not essential to life, while it cautiously
          left uninjured the heart, arteries, lungs, and intestines, —
          should we not regard such an instance as a perfect prodigy, as
          an example of instinctive forbearance almost miraculous? [The
          last three quotes come from the 1856, and last pre-Darwinian,
          edition of Kirby and Spence's <i>Introduction</i> <i>to</i>
          <i>Entomology</i>. ]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">This tradition of attempting to read moral
        meaning from nature did not cease with the triumph of
        evolutionary theory in 1859—for evolution could be read as God's
        chosen method of peopling our planet, and ethical messages might
        still populate nature. Thus, St. George Mivart, one of Darwin's
        most effective evolutionary critics and a devout Catholic,
        argued that "many amiable and excellent people" had been misled
        by the apparent suffering of animals for two reasons. First,
        whatever the pain, "physical suffering and moral evil are simply
        incommensurable." Since beasts are not moral agents, their
        feelings cannot bear any ethical message. But secondly, lest our
        visceral sensitivities still be aroused, Mivart assures us that
        animals must feel little, if any, pain. Using a favorite racist
        argument of the time — that "primitive" people suffer far less
        than advanced and cultured folk — Mivart extrapolated further
        down the ladder of life into a realm of very limited pain
        indeed: Physical suffering, he argued,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">depends greatly upon the mental condition of
          the sufferer. Only during consciousness does it exist, and
          only in the most highly organized men does it reach its acme.
          The author has been assured that lower races of men appear
          less keenly sensitive to physical suffering than do more
          cultivated and refined human beings. Thus only in man can
          there really be any intense degree of suffering, because only
          in him is there that intellectual recollection of past moments
          and that anticipation of future ones, which constitute in
          great part the bitterness of suffering. The momentary pang,
          the present pain, which beasts endure, though real enough, is
          yet, doubtless, not to be compared as to its intensity with
          the suffering which is produced in man through his high
          prerogative of self-consciousness [from <i>Genesis</i> <i>of</i>
          <i>Species</i>, 1871].</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">It took Darwin himself to derail this ancient
        tradition — and he proceeded in the gentle way so characteristic
        of his radical intellectual approach to nearly everything. The
        ichneumons also troubled Darwin greatly and he wrote of them to
        Asa Gray in 1860:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">I own that I cannot see as plainly as others
          do, and as I should wish to do, evidence of design and
          beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much
          misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a
          beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created
          the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding
          within the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should
          play with mice.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">Indeed, he had written with more passion to
        Joseph Hooker in 1856: "What a book a devil's chaplain might
        write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low, and horribly
        cruel works of nature!"</p>
      <p align="Justify">This honest admission — that nature is often
        (by our standards) cruel and that all previous attempts to find
        a lurking goodness behind everything represent just so much
        special pleading — can lead in two directions. One might retain
        the principle that nature holds moral messages, but reverse the
        usual perspective and claim that morality consists in
        understanding the ways of nature and doing the opposite. Thomas
        Henry Huxley advanced this argument in his famous essay on <i>Evolution</i>
        <i>and</i> <i>Ethics</i> (1893):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">The practice of that which is ethically best
          — what we call goodness or virtue — involves a course of
          conduct which, in all respects, is opposed to that which leads
          to success in the cosmic struggle for existence. In place of
          ruthless self-assertion it demands self-restraint; in place of
          thrusting aside, or treading down, all competitors, it
          requires that the individual shall not merely respect, but
          shall help his fellows. . . . It repudiates the gladiatorial
          theory of existence.… Laws and moral precepts are directed to
          the end of curbing the cosmic process.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">The other argument, radical in Darwin's day but
        more fimiliar now, holds that nature simply is as we find it.
        Our failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack
        of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature
        contains no moral messages framed in human terms. Morality is a
        subject for philosophers, theologians, students of the
        humanities, indeed for all thinking people. The answers will not
        be read passively from nature; they do not, and cannot, arise
        from the data of science. The factual state of the world does
        not teach us how we, with our powers for good and evil, should
        alter or preserve it in the most ethical manner.</p>
      <p align="Justify">Darwin himself tended toward this view,
        although he could not, as a man of his time, thoroughly abandon
        the idea that laws of nature might reflect some higher purpose.
        He clearly recognized that the specific manifestations of those
        laws — cats playing with mice, and ichneumon larvae eating
        caterpillars — could not embody ethical messages, but he somehow
        hoped that unknown higher laws might exist "with the details,
        whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call
        chance."</p>
      <p align="Justify">Since ichneumons are a detail, and since
        natural selection is a law regulating details, the answer to the
        ancient dilemma of why such cruelty (in our terms) exists in
        nature can only be that there isn't any answer — and that
        framing the question "in our terms" is thoroughly inappropriate
        in a natural world neither made for us nor ruled by us. It just
        plain happens. It is a strategy that works for ichneumons and
        that natural selection has programmed into their behavioral
        repertoire. Caterpillars are not suffering to teach us
        something; they have simply been outmaneuvered, for now, in the
        evolutionary game. Perhaps they will evolve a set of adequate
        defenses sometime in the future, thus sealing the fate of
        ichneumons. And perhaps, indeed probably, they will not.</p>
      <p align="Justify">Another Huxley, Thomas's grandson Julian, spoke
        for this position, using as an example — yes, you guessed it —
        the ubiquitous ichneumons:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">Natural selection, in fact, though like the
          mills of God in grinding slowly and grinding small, has few
          other attributes that a civilized religion would call divine.
          . . . Its products are just as likely to be aesthetically,
          morally, or intellectually repulsive to us as they are to be
          attractive. We need only think of the ugliness of <i>Sacculina</i>
          or a bladder-worm, the stupidity of a rhinoceros or a
          stegosaur, the horror of a female mantis devouring its mate or
          a brood of ichneumon flies slowly eating out a caterpillar.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="Justify">[It is amusing in this context, or rather
        ironic since it is too serious to be amusing, that modern
        creationists accuse evolutionists of preaching a specific
        ethical doctrine called secular humanism and thereby demand
        equal time for their unscientific and discredited views.] If
        nature is nonmoral, then evolution cannot teach any ethical
        theory at all. The assumption that it can has abetted a panoply
        of social evils that ideologues falsely read into nature from
        their beliefs — eugenics and (misnamed) social Darwinism
        prominently among them. Not only did Darwin eschew any attempt
        to discover an antireligious ethic in nature, he also expressly
        stated his personal bewilderment about such deep issues as the
        problem of evil. Just a few sentences after invoking the
        ichneumons, and in words that express both the modesty of this
        splendid man and the compatibility, through lack of contact,
        between science and true religion, Darwin wrote to Asa Gray,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="Justify">I feel most deeply that the whole subject is
          too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well
          speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and believe
          what he can.</p>

AN AMERICAN AGENDA FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER <br>  
   C. ORGANIZING FOR COLLECTIVE SECURITY <br>  
   D. LAUNCHING AN ECONOMIC-ENVIRONMENTAL REVOLUTION <br>   <br>  

(Senate - July 01, 1992) <br>   <br>  

Mr. BIDEN: <br>  
Mr. President, in two previous addresses on the new world order, I began by
placing this concept in historical perspective and then proposed a four-part agenda that I
believe this Nation must pursue in order to realize the full potential inherent in that
momentous phrase. <br>  
It is my contention that we must look to history for inspiration in this task: To the vision of
Woodrow Wilson and the subsequent achievements of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman in
laying the groundwork for fulfillment of the Wilsonian vision.
It is, I believe, the duty of this generation of Americans to complete the task that Woodrow
Wilson began. <br>  
Today, I shall describe the third and fourth parts of America's agenda for a new world order:
organizing for collective military security, and launching a worldwide economic-environmental
revolution. <br>  
In advancing, on a new world order agenda, toward an expanded commitment to the
collective use of armed force, where necessary. <br>  
We have two, related avenues for progress. <br>  
The first avenue involves a new role for NATO; the second, a more regularized exercise of
the enforcement power of the United Nations Security Council. <br>  
The collapse of the Soviet empire would by itself require that we reexamine NATO's
premises; the Atlantic alliance was created to deter a threat that no longer exists.
But this task is given urgency by the endemic violence now scarring the European
landscape. <br>  
How do we prevent such conflicts? <br>  
And how do we respond, should they erupt? <br>  
By inviting the former states of the Warsaw Pact into a new North Atlantic cooperation
council--the so-called NAC-C [Nack-See]. <br>  
NATO has wisely moved beyond the cold war to create an all-European consultative body
that can play a useful educational and advisory role on matters of security.
But consultation is not enough. <br>  

NATO's integrated planning and command structure constitutes an asset unique in the
world. <br>  
Of all the world's multinational institutions--a veritable alphabet soup--only NATO has the
ability to bring coordinated, multinational military force to bear.
But if this asset is to be relevant to post-cold war realities, it must be reoriented to serve
the current security interests of alliance members.
Militarily, NATO has not yet adapted to the post-cold war era. Even as it now develops a
new strategy that will accommodate reduced force levels, its military orientation remains
unchanged: It remains the defense of allied territory against direct attack.
This military posture is an anachronism. <br>  
Instead of tiptoeing toward a revised mandate, NATO should make a great leap forward--by
adopting peacekeeping outside NATO territory as a formal alliance mission.</p>
